# Ludo-for-CodeNationGameJam
The Ludo board game as a 48h hackathon for CodeNation

Written in collaboration with @nicoleAMS

Code can be improved obviously but it seems to be working.

Knonw bugs (or "features") : 
- When you roll a 6 you sometimes have only 1 pawn you can move and the game will ask you to pick which one you can move (but you will only be able to move 1)
- When you roll a 6, have pawns on the board but they can't move and still have pawn(s) on the yard. If you have a pawn on your starting position, the game will ask you to swap it with one of your yard.
